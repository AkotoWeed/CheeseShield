## CheeseShield - The Ultimate Anti-Crash Plugin for Your Minecraft Server!

### Overview:
CheeseShield is the perfect plugin to protect your Minecraft server from common crash causes and exploits! Equipped with a variety of intelligent methods, CheeseShield detects malicious activity and prevents attacks before they can destabilize your server. Say goodbye to annoying crashes and lag—just smooth gameplay for you and your players!

### Key Features:

- **Exploit Detection**: Protects against both known and new exploits that could crash your server or disrupt gameplay.
- **Auto-Adjust Performance**: CheeseShield dynamically adjusts based on server load and player activity.
- **Advanced Logging**: Track all suspicious actions in real-time.
- **Network Overload Protection**: Prevents attacks that aim to overload server resources.
- **Lag-Free Play**: Optimized to ensure CheeseShield does not impact your server's performance.

### How It Works:

CheeseShield is loaded with several custom methods that handle a wide range of threats to keep your server stable. Here’s a quick look at what each method does:

#### Example Methods:

1. **`preventItemStackOverflow()`**
   - Detects and removes any maliciously large item stacks that could cause crashes or lag spikes.
   
2. **`blockInvalidPacketFlood()`**
   - Blocks excessive invalid packet requests that could potentially overwhelm the server, maintaining a smooth experience.

3. **`throttleLoginAttempts()`**
   - Limits the frequency of login attempts to prevent login spamming that could crash your server.

4. **`fixChunkCorruption()`**
   - Automatically identifies and repairs corrupt chunks that could cause players to crash when they load specific areas.

5. **`validatePlayerData()`**
   - Ensures that player data being loaded is valid, preventing crashes from corrupted player files.

6. **`monitorEntitySpawns()`**
   - Limits entity spawns per region to prevent entity overload, which is a common cause of server lag and crashes.

7. **`sanitizeCommandInput()`**
   - Scans and sanitizes all player input commands, blocking potentially dangerous syntax that could lead to unintended server crashes.

8. **`autoPurgeLaggingEntities()`**
   - Detects and removes entities that are causing significant lag, optimizing performance in high-population areas.

9. **`dynamicWorldLoadBalancer()`**
   - Manages world loading in real-time to prevent crashes when too many chunks are loaded at once.

10. **`detectItemDuplicationGlitch()`**
    - Identifies and removes any items generated by known duplication glitches, keeping the economy balanced and stable.

### Configuration:
CheeseShield is highly configurable, allowing you to enable or disable specific methods, set thresholds, and adjust the intensity of each protective feature. Customize it to suit your server’s unique needs!
